<h1>The Best Movies According to Chandranshu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bloody Daddy</h3>
<p>No wonder why Ambani thought to directly dump this film on Jio Cinema ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜† its not for theatres but totally for ott.</p>
<h3>Pathaan</h3>
<p>Stylish, slick and action-packed film; in one work itâ€™s a â€˜Blockbusterâ€™.</p>
<h3>Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar</h3>
<p>The trio perspective what a family, a guy and also the girl must actually look into and find the solution rather than cribbing and destroying relationship! ðŸ¥°.</p>
